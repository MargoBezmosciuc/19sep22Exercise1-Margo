      The Last Samurai is a 2003 epic period action drama film directed and
      co-produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John
      Logan and Marshall Herskovitz from a story devised by Logan. The film
      stars Ken Watanabe in the title role, with Tom Cruise, who also
      co-produced, as a soldier-turned-samurai who befriends him, and Timothy
      Spall, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Koyuki, and Shin
      Koyamada in supporting roles. Tom Cruise portrays an American captain of
      the 7th Cavalry Regiment, whose personal and emotional conflicts bring him
      into contact with samurai warriors in the wake of the Meiji Restoration in
      19th century Japan. The film's plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma
      Rebellion led by Saig≈ç Takamori, and the Westernization of Japan by
      foreign powers, though in the film the United States is portrayed as the
      primary force behind the push for Westernization. It is also influenced by
      the stories of Jules Brunet, a French Imperial Guard sub-lieutenant who
      fought alongside Enomoto Takeaki in the earlier Boshin War; Philip Kearny,
      a United States Army (Union Army) major general and French Imperial Guard
      soldier, notable for his leadership in the American Civil War, who fought
      against the Tututni tribe in the Rogue River Wars in Oregon; and, to a
      lesser extent, by Frederick Townsend Ward, an American mercenary who
      helped Westernize the Chinese army by forming the Ever Victorious Army.
